# SMUI SvelteKit Example

An example project implementing [Svelte Material UI](https://github.com/hperrin/svelte-material-ui) with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

# Get it Running

1. Clone the repo.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. `npm start`
5. http://localhost:3000

I don't know why, but using `npm run dev` doesn't work right now. You get a 500 error with a message like this:

```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../smui-example-sveltekit/node_modules/@material/ripple/index.ts'
```
